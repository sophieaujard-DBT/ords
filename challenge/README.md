# ORDS Metadata Compliance Challenge
## Overview
Welcome to the Open Regulation Document Standard (ORDS) Challenge!

This challenge invites developers, data enthusiasts, and RegTech innovators to explore how metadata can transform regulatory compliance. 

ORDS is an open standard designed to make regulatory documents easier to find, understand, and act on. By adding consistent metadata to guidance, codes of conduct, and standards, we can unlock powerful tools for businesses and regulators alike.

## Why ORDS Matters
Finding and understanding regulation constitute significant frictional costs for businesses, with some estimates suggesting administrative costs could be between 3-4% of GDP.

Challenges arise because:
* Regulations are scattered across 90+ regulators, in different formats.
* Finding relevant guidance is time-consuming and costly.
* AI and digital tools struggle without structured metadata.

ORDS solves this by providing a common metadata schema for regulatory documents, enabling:
* Better search and filtering
* Alerts for updates
* Decision-making tools
* RegTech integration
* Improved policy visibility

## Your Challenge
Build something innovative using ORDS metadata!

We've provided:
* A sample dataset of regulatory documents with ORDS metadata.
* The ORDS schema (properties and descriptions).
* Starter code for loading and parsing metadata.

Bonus: Submit a short report of issues encountered and suggestions for improving ORDS.  

## What can you build?
Here are some ideas:

* **Search & Filter Tool:** A web app that lets users filter documents by sector, audience, or legislation.
* **Compliance Dashboard:** Visualise regulatory coverage by industry or region.
* **AI Summarisation Tool:** Use metadata to improve relevance in summarising regulatory documents.
* **Alert System:** Notify businesses when documents tagged with certain metadata change.
* **RegTech API:** Prototype an API that exposes metadata for compliance tools.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Relevance:** Does your solution solve a real problem for businesses or regulators?  
  
**Metadata Incorporation:** How well does it leverage ORDS?  
  
**Ease of Use:** Is it clear and accessible for others to use?
